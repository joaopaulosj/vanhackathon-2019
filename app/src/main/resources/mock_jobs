They’ll also be able to provide emotional support when things go wrong and be able to get team members motivated to make things happen. \n \n The impact we’re looking for is as follows:  \n \n Within...  \n \n  1 month:  Understand the VanHack product inside and out and gain the trust of the sales team so you can start managing and improving things as needed. \n  3 months:  You will have hired you first 2 sales reps and have improved upon our current onboarding process to ensure they are successful. You’ll also have closed at least 3 deals of your own since you are still hungry to get your hands dirty and lead by example. \n  6 months:  You’ll have added at least $500,000 of new revenue to the topline from your deals and the deal you’ll have helped new and existing reps close. You’ll also have hired 4 more additional sales reps who will be onboarded and ready to go. Finally, you may have made some changes to the team if necessary. \n  12 months:  You’ll have added at least $1M of new revenue to the topline from the deals the team would not have closed without your guidance. You’ll have trained 10 new reps who are performing well and meeting quota. You’ll be speaking at conferences and seen as a thought leader in the HR Tech space and be a magnet for new business and talent. You’ll be a trusted partner on the VanHack Management team and frequently share your opinion on how we can improve the company as a whole. \n \n The background we think you’ll need to be successful is (but anyone can apply who thinks they’re up for the opportunity): \n \n · 5-10 years of sales experience \n · 3-5 years of sales team management experience \n · Proven ability to hit quota \n · Loves working in a fast-paced environment \n · Experience working in a startup \n · Experience working remotely (or really excited about it) \n · HR experience a plus",
